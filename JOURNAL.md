I started by watching this YouTube video to try and understand the basics of creating combat robots.

I started researching what **E**lectronic **S**peed **C**ontroller to use and came across the [Malenki-Nano](https://botbitz.com.au/collections/antweight-parts/products/malenki-nano), which combines a lot of the functions I need, reducing weight and allowing enough excess to implement a cool weapon.

I got started researching all the parts I would need including a second ESC for a larger motor.

I have begun CAD to make the chassis where all the parts will fit into.

I am mostly done with the CAD side; there's just a few things I need to do and I should be off to the races.

I improved on the design a lot, including making it a lot stronger, shrinking to allow for TPU deflectors, and moving stuff around to allow for a much bigger weapon.

Next time, I'll get working on the TPU deflectors, actually modelling out the weapon, and other things nessecary to get it competition ready, such as adding a power switch and alan key power switch.

We now have a TPU deflector and a full blade. The deflector was a bit challenging because putting it in required the body to be significantly smaller to still fit within the 4inx4in limit.

The weapon was made to fit this standoff, which I repurposed as a hex-shaped shaft to attach the weapon to the M5 bolt on the motor.

I added the [FingerTech Mini Power Switch](https://repeat-robotics.com/buy/fingertech-switch/) because it stops a switch from needing to be on the top which could be unintentionally triggered.

Originally, I couldn't find a place to mount it.

But then I realized I could use the little cutouts on the side and add inserts that would allow me to attach it to the left wheel well.

In the bot's full current form, it looks like this:

I made [Logan Peterson](https://github.com/SharKingStudios)'s' requested changes, including uploading the files and adding prices to the BOM. I also heavily optimized the BOM to keep it as cheap as possible, including going for a fully 3D printed weapon (we'll have to see how that one goes).
