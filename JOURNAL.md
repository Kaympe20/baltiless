I started researching what **E**lectronic **S**peed **C**ontroller to use and came across the [Malenki-Nano](https://botbitz.com.au/collections/antweight-parts/products/malenki-nano), which combines a lot of the functions I need, reducing weight and allowing enough excess to implement a cool weapon.
