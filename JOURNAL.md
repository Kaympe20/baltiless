I started by watching this YouTube video to try and understand the basics of creating combat robots.

I started researching what **E**lectronic **S**peed **C**ontroller to use and came across the [Malenki-Nano](https://botbitz.com.au/collections/antweight-parts/products/malenki-nano), which combines a lot of the functions I need, reducing weight and allowing enough excess to implement a cool weapon.

I got started researching all the parts I would need including a second ESC for a larger motor.

I have begun CAD to make the chassis where all the parts will fit into.

I am mostly done with the CAD side; there's just a few things I need to do and I should be off to the races.

I improved on the design a lot, including making it a lot stronger, shrinking to allow for TPU deflectors, and moving stuff around to allow for a much bigger weapon.

Next time, I'll get working on the TPU deflectors, actually modelling out the weapon, and other things nessecary to get it competition ready, such as adding a power switch and alan key power switch.

We now have a TPU deflector and a full blade. The deflector was a bit challenging because putting it in required the body to be significantly smaller to still fit within the 4inx4in limit.

The weapon was made to fit this standoff, which I repurposed as a hex-shaped shaft to attach the weapon to the M5 bolt on the motor.
