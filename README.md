I made this project because I love doing robotics, but so many robotics leagues are both prohibitively expensive and require a team. I started on combat robot stuff because I saw a Maker's Muse video on antweight design and I really wanted to experience it myself.

The name and theming are inspired from [this iconic ad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQVhb4DxHnw)
